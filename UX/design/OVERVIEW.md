# Aquivis v5 â€“ Design System Overview (Draft)

Purpose: Provide a clean-room, production-ready UI/UX foundation. Insights only; no code/assets reused from prior apps.

## Principles
- Task-first, progressive disclosure, one clear flow per action
- Readable, accessible, consistent; fast perceived performance
- Predictable components with deliberate states and motion

## Structure
- Tokens: color, typography, spacing, radii, shadows, motion
- Components: primitives and composites with states
- Layouts: dashboard, inbox + side panel, 6-step service wizard
- Accessibility: WCAG AA targets, keyboard/focus, labels
- Evidence: performance, a11y, and usability checks per feature

## Navigation Model
- Top bar primary navigation; page-level toolbar near content
- Inbox default entry; split-view list + side panel for triage

See `TOKENS.md`, `COMPONENTS.md`, `LAYOUTS.md`, and `ACCESSIBILITY.md` for detailed specs.
