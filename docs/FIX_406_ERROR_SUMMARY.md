# Fix for HTTP 406 Error on Settings Pages

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed - Ready for Verification

---

## Problem

All settings pages were returning HTTP 406 errors:
- Profile page: Blank email field
- Company page: Blank cards
- Team page: Blank cards

**Root Cause:** RLS policy on `profiles` table was too restrictive. It required `request_company_id()` to return a value (from JWT claims), but the JWT doesn't have `company_id` set because:
1. Onboarding creates profiles but doesn't update Supabase Auth user metadata
2. No database trigger exists to sync profile changes to JWT claims yet

---

## Solution

### 1. Updated RLS Policy (Migration #5)
**File:** `DB/schema/050_fix_profile_rls.sql`

Changed from:
```sql
CREATE POLICY profiles_select ON profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (company_id = request_company_id());
```

To:
```sql
CREATE POLICY profiles_select ON profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (
    auth.uid() = id  -- Can read own profile
    OR company_id = request_company_id()  -- Can read company profiles if JWT has company_id
  );
```

**Result:** Users can now read their own profile even without JWT claims set.

### 2. Improved Code
- **Profile page:** Gets email directly from session
- **Company page:** Added better logging
- **Team page:** Added better logging
- All pages now handle errors gracefully

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `apps/web/app/settings/profile/page.tsx` - Get email from session, not database
2. `apps/web/app/settings/company/page.tsx` - Added console logging
3. `apps/web/app/settings/team/page.tsx` - Added console logging
4. `DB/schema/050_fix_profile_rls.sql` - NEW FILE - Fixed RLS policy

### Database Migration:
- ✅ Migration #5 applied: `fix_profile_rls`
- ✅ New RLS policy active

---

## Verification Steps

1. **Refresh browser** at http://localhost:3000
2. **Check Profile page:**
   - Go to `/settings/profile`
   - Should see email filled in
   - Check console for "Profile query result:" log
3. **Check Company page:**
   - Go to `/settings/company`
   - Should see company name and timezone
   - Check console logs
4. **Check Team page:**
   - Go to `/settings/team`
   - Should see team members (if any)
   - Check console logs

---

## What Changed in Database

**Before:**
- Policy: `company_id = request_company_id()` only
- Result: Blocked if JWT missing company_id

**After:**
- Policy: `auth.uid() = id OR company_id = request_company_id()`
- Result: Works with or without JWT claims

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Refresh browser to load new code
2. ✅ Visit each settings page
3. ✅ Verify data loads correctly
4. ✅ Check console for success logs (not errors)
5. Report if still seeing issues

---

## Important Notes

- **Profile email:** Now read from `session.user.email` (supabase auth)
- **RLS is working:** Just made it more permissive for own profile
- **JWT claims TODO:** We still need to add a trigger to sync profile → JWT claims (future work)
- **Security:** Users can only read their own profile, not other profiles (unless same company AND JWT has company_id)
