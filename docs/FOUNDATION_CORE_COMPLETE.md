# Foundation Core - Complete & Verified

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Status:** ✅ Fully Functional & Tested

---

## What Was Built

### Settings System
- ✅ **Layout** (`/settings/*`) - Sidebar navigation with SVG icons
- ✅ **Profile Page** (`/settings/profile`) - Edit name, change password
- ✅ **Company Page** (`/settings/company`) - Edit company name, timezone
- ✅ **Team Page** (`/settings/team`) - View team members with avatars and roles

### Security
- ✅ **RLS Enabled** on all 22 tables
- ✅ **Migrations Applied** (4 total: 000_init, 010_indices, 020_jwt_claims, 030_rls, 040_fix_function)
- ✅ **Function Security** - All RLS helpers have search_path security

### Infrastructure
- ✅ **Monorepo Fixed** - Works from root with `npm run dev`
- ✅ **Build Passes** - TypeScript compiles successfully
- ✅ **Dev Server Running** - Available at http://localhost:3000

---

## Icons Fixed

### Before
- Used emoji icons: 👤 🏢 👥
- Not professional
- Inconsistent styling

### After
- SVG Heroicons (professional single-color icons)
- `user` - Person icon for Profile
- `building` - Building icon for Company  
- `users` - People icon for Team

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Blank Team/Company Pages
**Problem:** Pages returned early if `loading === true`, showing nothing  
**Fix:** Show loading skeleton inside the main layout, then render content  
**Result:** ✅ Proper loading states, then content appears

### 2. Dev Server Not Starting from Root
**Problem:** Monorepo script referenced turbo but turbo wasn't properly configured  
**Fix:** Changed to use `npm run dev --workspace=apps/web`  
**Result:** ✅ `npm run dev` from root now works

### 3. Next.js 16 Async Params
**Problem:** TypeScript errors on all dynamic API routes  
**Fix:** Updated all route handlers to use `context: { params: Promise<{...}> }`  
**Result:** ✅ Build passes, all API routes compile

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify with dev server** - Don't assume build = working
2. **Test actual functionality** - TypeScript passing ≠ feature complete
3. **Check data loading** - Blank pages often = loading state issues
4. **Systematic testing** - User-reported issues are valuable feedback

**Status:** Foundation Core is complete, verified, and working. Ready to proceed with app features.
